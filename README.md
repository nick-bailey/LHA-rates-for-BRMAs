The process here uses open data throughout. The resulting file is published under an Open Government Licence (OGL)  (https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/). LHA rates are published under OGL. Use is also made of an open boundary file for BRMAs created by Owen Boswarva and published on his Datadaptive website (https://www.datadaptive.com/?pg=2), also under OGL.
